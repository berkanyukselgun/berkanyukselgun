Iâ€™m Berkan from Turkiye, and I'm Flutter Developer.I graduated from Karadeniz Technical University, Department of City and Regional Planning in 2016. I worked as a city planner for 5 years. During my tenure, I was an urban design specialist and project manager at the company. But this was not my dream career. I applied to Google Game and App Academy in 2022 and took the first step. I have successfully completed game development training with Flutter. In the graduation project, I worked as a scrum master and developer in the team. I graduated from the academy in 2023. I am currently studying computer programming and I am gaining experience in mobile application development by developing my own basic applications. You can check out my social media profiles.
